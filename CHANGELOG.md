  instructions.
- Native `GenerateContent` and `StreamGenerateContent` exposing the full
  generation config, tool config and response schema.
- Embeddings (`EmbedContent`, `Embed`), token counting (`CountTokens`) and
  models (`Models`, `GetModel`).
- Functional options: `WithBaseURL`, `WithHTTPClient`, `WithTimeout`,
  `WithMaxRetries`, `WithHeader`.
- Retries on 429 and 5xx with backoff; normalized `*ai.APIError` errors.
